Diabetes Prediction using Machine LearningThis project aims to predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on various health-related features. We experimented with several machine learning models to find the most accurate predictor.Project OverviewThe primary goal of this project is to build a highly accurate classification model for diabetes prediction. We explored and evaluated five different algorithms on a comprehensive diabetes dataset. Our analysis showed that the XGBoost Classifier provided the highest accuracy among the tested models.DatasetThe dataset used for this project is the "Diabetes Prediction Dataset" available on Kaggle. It contains several medical predictor variables and one target variable, diabetes.Dataset Link: Diabetes Prediction DatasetModels and ResultsWe implemented and evaluated the performance of the following five machine learning models:Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)Logistic RegressionRandom ForestXGBoost ClassifierAfter rigorous training and testing, the models yielded the following accuracies:ModelAccuracyXGBoost Classifier97.07%Random Forest(Your Accuracy)CNN(Your Accuracy)Logistic Regression(Your Accuracy)K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)(Your Accuracy)The XGBoost model emerged as the top-performing model with an impressive accuracy of 97.07%.Technologies UsedProgramming Language: PythonLibraries:PandasNumPyScikit-learnXGBoostTensorFlow / Keras (for CNN)Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)How to Run the ProjectTo replicate the results, please follow these steps:Clone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
